# Setting up environment variables

1. Create a custom programmable search engine using [this link](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all). Get the search engine ID and put it in the .env file.
2. Get a Custom Search API key using the following [link](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview).

Your .env file should look something like this:
```
SEARCH_API_KEY="API_KEY_HERE" # Surround both in quotes.
CSE_ID="SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE"
```

An example .env file has been included in the repo.
**Note**: If you are not running Ollama on your local machine, please specify the API url for your Ollama server using OLLAMA_URL in your .env file. If you are running this in a docker container, ensure that the container running this repository has the OLLAMA_URL environment variable set accordingly.

# Questions

A questions.json is included in the repo. It consists of questions from the training set of [MedMCQA](https://medmcqa.github.io/).
